## Introduction
Many of Google's own products tend to have shorter lifespans than others. Google tends to launch products they aren't sure will catch on, hardly market them at all, and then eventually shut them down entirely. These products are honored in the [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

Google Guillotine is a satirical web app and reversal of the Google Graveyard that imagines what it might look like if the users themselves could vote on which product or service should be shut down (killed) next.

## Features
